# GenHack-2025
GenHack 2025 is a four-week collaborative hackathon on Urban Heat Islands and
Climate Downscaling, organized by the BNP Paribas “Stress Test” Chair and École
Polytechnique.
We will explore the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect using ERA5 temperature data,
Sentinel-2 NDVI maps, and ground-station observations to understand and model
local climate variations.
